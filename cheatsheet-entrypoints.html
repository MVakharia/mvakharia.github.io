    <h3>HTML</h3>

    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-html">Learn HTML on Codecademy</a>

    <ul>
      <li>You've covered most of the HTML in the Full Stack pathway, and the HTML Codecademy course is now at 73%.</li>

      <li>Now, go over the HTML in your Study Topics while doing the easier pending coursework.</li>

      <li>
        The final HTML section is later in the Full Stack Developer course.
        You don't need to go out of your way to do it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>

  </ul>

  <p>Section 34 - API Development with Swagger and OpenAPI</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This is a certificate all on its own, and supposedly takes under an hour. 9 articles, 2 informationals, and

      quiz.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Section 41 - Fundamentals of OS's</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A software engineering culture and set of practices

  <ul>
    <li>jQuery is a JavaScript library, but according to Codecademy's website, there are no prerequisites for
      studying
      it.
    </li>
    <li>At the very least, complete Codecademy's 'Learn JavaScript' course before you get started on jQuery.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>You were able to ask permission to skip the ITCS content and go straight to the Codecademy content.</li>
    <li>All the Python code you wrote while studying with ITCS needs to be uploaded to GitHub.</li>
    <li>Study Python when you need a break from the more difficult parts of the course.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <a href="https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/
        flexbox-business-site/example-site/index.html">This project</a>
    is about a thousand times easier than Fotomatic:
    I'll come back to it when I want to play around and make something to practice HTML and CSS.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I will build a company home page for Blue Carbon Media.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenge Project - Making a website responsive</h3>

  <p>
    Like the project above, this is much easier than Fotomatic, but to a lesser degree.
    I'll come back to it in future when I want to make something to practise HTML and CSS.
