    <h2>PHP</h2>

    <p>The difference between static and dynamic web pages.</p>

    <p>To interpolate strings in PHP, use the dollar symbol.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to do string interpolation in PHP:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add the variable, preceded by $, directly into the string.</li>

        <li>
            Place brackets around the variable name (leaving the $ outside the brackets)
            when the string variable needs to be directly adjacent to another character:
            for example, when you want to add a suffix.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The difference between assignment by reference and assignment by value</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Creating a variable 'b' and assigning it another variable 'a' means that
            'b' is an independent entity with a different memory location to 'a'.
            It only has the same value in common with 'a'.
            'b' will not change if the value of 'a' is changed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a reference 'c' and assigning it 'a' using the reference assignment operator '=&'
            means that 'c' should refer to the exact same memory location as 'a'.
            This means that 'c' will change when 'a' is changed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Order of operations (PEMDAS)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Parentheses</li>
        <li>Exponents</li>
        <li>Multiplication</li>
        <li>Division</li>
        <li>Addition</li>
        <li>Subtraction</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Using & to pass by reference</p>

    <ul>
        <li>PHP's equivalent to C#'s 'ref' keyword is the '&' operator prepended to the variable, for example
            &$variable.
        </li>
    </ul>
